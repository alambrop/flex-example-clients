# Flex Examples #

This repository contains example client code for [FlightStats' Flex API products](https://developer.flightstats.com/).

At this time, we don't actively seek for bugs in this code or announce and publish bug fixes. That said, we are considering whether supported "thick client" for Flex would be useful to our developer community. If you feel strongly, one way or another, please let us know.
